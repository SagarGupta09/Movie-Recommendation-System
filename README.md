# Movie-Recommendation-System
simple movie recommendation system using OmDb APi
With personalised recommendations based on user interests, the Movie Recommendation System project seeks to transform the way people find and watch films. With so many movie options available on a variety of platforms in today's huge digital world, this kind of approach is highly relevant in terms of improving user experience and engagement when it comes to computer applications. 
The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API is used in the project to construct a movie recommendation system. The architecture, functionality, and user experience of the system are all thoroughly examined in this report.



1. System Architecture:
The system is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of its key components:

a. HTML Structure: Specifies how each web page is organised and structured, such as the home page, the page with movie details, and the watchlist page. 


b. CSS Styling: This improves the website's visual appeal and layout while guaranteeing an intuitive user experience. 

c. JavaScript Functionality: This adds interaction and functionality to the system by managing watchlists, dynamically displaying movie details, retrieving movie data from the OMDb API, and making movie recommendations based on genre selections. 

d. OMDb API Integration: This method retrieves movie information including titles, posters, ratings, genres, and plot summaries by interacting with the OMDb API.
